            We hold our annual Choreography Showcase at the end of Term 2 ( just before school holidays ).

            This year, the  Choreography Showcase is on  <b>June 29th from 10:00am -  12:00noon. </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Choreography Showcases are designed for the dancers to enjoy their creativity and design their own masterpiece!
            This is a non compulsory event where dancers choreograph, costume and perform their own routine to their choice of music, with a friend, group or solo performance.
            Music is requested to be no longer than three minutes per pieces.
            The showcase is held in the studio with a little party held afterwards ( Bring a plate style).
            This a free event for all age groups and styles. It is designed to build confidence!
        </p>
      
        <p>
           We will have some very confident dancers performing on the day. 
            It is always one of my favourite events for the year! ( Please make sure you get your entry details back to Miss Nat BEFORE June 28th).
